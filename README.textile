h1. Del.icio.us to WordPress

This ruby script connects to a del.icio.us account and fetches the bookmarks created during the last week. If new bookmarks exist in the specified account, it then creates a simple HTML string and uses it as an entry in any WordPress site, via the XML-RPC interface. Otherwise, it does nothing.

This script can be set up as a cron job, to run every Sunday evening for example.

Make sure to enable XML-RPC posting in your WordPress blog, by going to the "Settings / Writing" screen in the administration panel, and then checking the "XML-RPC Enable the WordPress, Movable Type, MetaWeblog and Blogger XML-RPC publishing protocols" checkbox.
